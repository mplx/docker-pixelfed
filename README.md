# Pixelfed-in-a-Container

## WORK IN PROGRESS - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK - EXPERIMENTAL

Currently the docker image is just available for the master development tree: `docker pull mplx/docker-pixelfed:master`. As I'm using it myself I'm trying to keep it as stable as possible, however as long as there are no [semver](https://semver.org/) tags you should consider this image to break anytime. So if you just wanna go for a selfhosted [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) testdrive this image is fine to use, however you shouldn't daily feed your thousands of followers with it.

[pixelfed](https://github.com/pixelfed/pixelfed) is a [federated](https://fediverse.party/) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/about/us/)-like photo sharing for everyone developed by [@dansup](https://github.com/dansup). This project puts this [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) in a docker container.

  - Autobuild at [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mplx/docker-pixelfed)
  - MultiArch (supports amd64, arm32v6, arm32v7 and arm32v8; however just amd64 is *extensively* tested. Yes, it will run on *Raspi* and other *Pi*'s)

Additional services required:
  - [Database](https://docs.pixelfed.org/technical-documentation/env.html#database-configuration) (MySQL 5.6+/MariaDB 10.2.7+, PostgreSQL 10+)
